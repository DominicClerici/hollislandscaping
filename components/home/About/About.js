          Hollis Landscaping has over 25 years of experience serving the
          maintenance and design needs of the bay area. We work closely with our
          clients to make their designs come to life, providing both a
          consultative and satisfying landscape that you can enjoy for many
          years.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We are trained horticulturalists providing the best advice on types of
          trees and plants to use for the desired effect. We consider drought
          tolerance, shade, slope, and drainage in your overall design. So each
          plant that we place has a role in your design, and compliments the
          hardscape, lighting, and irrigation for the desired outcome.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Hollis Landscaping relies on strategic partnerships with local
          providers for the landscape materials we use. We have relationships
          with nurseries, irrigation suppliers and landscape supply companies,
          enabling us to have very timely access to the best materials for your
          project. As a result, our landscape maintenance and design projects
          are completed efficiently and effectively for the best possible cost.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We use state-of-the-art machinery and equipment necessary to do every
          landscape job right the first time, and we pride ourselves for
          ensuring thorough clean-up after every project.
