          &quot;Hollis Landscaping was able to take the plans we outlined and
          create a beautiful design that not only maintained the theme of our
          home but brought a renewed energy to our front entrance through the
          use of colorful plants, drought tolerant shrubs, new sod and a lovely
          rock bed. We enjoy coming home now.&quot;

          &quot;Excellent professional landscape maintenance and design service.
          I highly recommend Hollis Landscaping&quot;

          &quot;Very good. Hollis Landscaping is responsive and their regular
          maintenance service has improved my site more than the previous
          contractor.&quot;
